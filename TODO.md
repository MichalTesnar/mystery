# Bugs
- learn to use debuggers
- fix retracing warnings
- debug simple dataset, inspect if it works correctly

# Planned Features
- active buffer method (greedy, threshold, greedy threshold)
- dynamic regret (AUC metric) + cite it in the paper
- setup procedure for hyperparameter search (take subset of the dataset with size of the buffer, then do magic)
