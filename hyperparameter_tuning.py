# Model
# Uncertainty Quantification Method (if not inherently part of the model)
# Number of data points in the buffer
# Model hyperparams (for the size of the training set)
# With fixed architecture can be searched once, then kept fixed for the rest of the time.
# Take a random subset of the training set, figure out on those and keep it fixed.
# Kept variable
# Amount of training â€“ relative to the model
# Keep patience of EarlyStopping fixed
