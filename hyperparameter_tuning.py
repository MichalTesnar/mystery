# Model
# Number of data points in the buffer -- set to a fixed number, let us say 10% of the dataset?

# Take the first 10% of the data, cause that is all that you can get, cross-validate on it
# With fixed architecture can be searched once, then kept fixed for the rest of the time.


# doing complexity analysis -- toy the task to learn it? 

# Looking for
    # MLP size: layers, neurons
    # implement l2?
    # Training: batch size, patience, maximum epochs, learning rate
    # uncertainty: number of estimators? Tradeoffs?
    # keep fixed: MSE loss, adam, activation relu->relu + linear

# we will flush all the data through this
