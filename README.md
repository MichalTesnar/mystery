# Uncertainty in Active Incremental Online Learning
Welcome to the repository of my thesis! I hope you will be enlightened by the awesome things that you will learn here!

## Project Content
In this project, we investigate the use of uncertainty quantification in the online incremental learning setting in two tasks. One is an artificial dataset generated by a sinus curve. The other

## How to setup?
### Get _Python 3_.
I will leave that up to you...

### Clone the repo.

```git clone https://github.com/MichalTesnar/mystery```

### Get _Keras Uncertainty_, the library for uncertainty quantification in Keras.

```pip install --user git+https://github.com/mvaldenegro/keras-uncertainty.git```

### Install dependencies.

```pip install -r dependencies.txt```

### Configure the project
Altering the `experiment_specification` variable in `main.py` to change hyperparameters.
Change the dataset object to be either `SinusiodToyExample` or `DagonAUVDataset`, depending on the dataset of choice.


### RUN!

```python3 main.py```

Your resulting plots will be saved in `/results`.
